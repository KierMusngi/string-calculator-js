## Scripts

### `npm install`

This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on. If the package has a package-lock or shrinkwrap file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, with an npm-shrinkwrap.json taking precedence if both files exist. See package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.

### `npm test`

This runs a package’s “test” script, if one was provided.<br>
Launches jest to run all test cases.<br>
